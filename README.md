# pet-adoption-analysis
A data analysis project on improving pet adoption rates using SQL and Tableau

## Project Overview
This project explores historical adoption data from an animal shelter to identify trends and improve adoption outcomes. Using SQL and Tableau, the analysis focuses on understanding adoption timing, adopter behavior, and pet characteristics to inform strategy.

**Original Dataset**: [Pet Adoption Records on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaudharisanika/pet-adoption-records-with-animal-and-adopter-data)

**Business Question:**  
How can this shelter improve pet adoption rates and optimize the adoption process using animal and adopter data?

## Key Insights
- Hamsters are adopted the fastest; Cats are adopted the slowest
- Older adopters with previous pet ownership adopt more quickly
- Adoptions peak in June, followed by January, February, and August
- Certain Cat and Dog breeds are returned more frequently

Visualizations can be found in the [`tableau/`](./tableau/) folder. 

## Tools and Skills Used
- SQL (MySQL): Data segmentation and time-based analysis
- Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- Excel / CSV: Data cleaning and preparation

Keywords: adoption trends, pet return risk, segmentation, seasonal analysis, data storytelling, SQL analysis

## Business Value
This analysis helps animal shelters:
- Reduce adoption delays by promoting under-adopted pets
- Target adopters more effectively based on behavior and experience
- Plan adoption campaigns around seasonal patterns
- Reduce pet returns through better matching and support programs
