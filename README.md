# pet-adoption-analysis
A data analysis project on improving pet adoption rates using SQL and Tableau

## Project Overview
This project explores historical adoption data from an animal shelter to identify trends and improve adoption outcomes. Using SQL and Tableau, the analysis focuses on understanding adoption timing, adopter behavior, and pet characteristics to inform strategy.

**Goal**: Use historical data to improve adoption rates and reduce pet returns through data-driven recommendations.

**Original Dataset**: [Pet Adoption Records on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaudharisanika/pet-adoption-records-with-animal-and-adopter-data)

**Business Question:**  
How can this shelter improve pet adoption rates and optimize the adoption process using animal and adopter data?

## Supporting Questions
- What types of pets are adopted most quickly?
- Which adopter demographics are associated with faster adoptions?
- Are there seasonal or regional patterns in adoption rates?
- What factors are associated with unsuccessful or delayed adoptions?

## Key Insights & Recommendations
### 1. **Adoption Speed by Pet Type**
- **Insight**: Hamsters are adopted the fastest; Cats are the slowest.
- **Recommendation**: Boost visibility of Cats through seasonal promotions or "adopt-a-cat" weeks.

### 2. **Adopter Demographics**
- **Insight**: Adopters aged **30+** with prior pet experience adopt pets faster.
- **Recommendation**: Launch referral or loyalty programs targeting experienced pet owners.

### 3. **Seasonal Adoption Trends**
- **Insight**: Peak adoptions occur in **June**, followed by **January** and **August**.
- **Recommendation**: Schedule adoption drives and marketing campaigns around **late Spring and Summer**.

### 4. **Pet Returns and Risk Factors**
- **Insight**: Cats and Dogs of certain high-maintenance breeds are returned more often.
- **Recommendation**: Offer post-adoption education and behavioral support for these specific breeds.

Visualizations can be found in the [`tableau/`](./tableau/) folder.
