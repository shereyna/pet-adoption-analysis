# pet-adoption-analysis
A data analysis project on improving pet adoption rates using SQL and Tableau

## Project Overview
This project explores historical adoption data from an animal shelter to identify trends and improve adoption outcomes. Using SQL and Tableau, the analysis focuses on understanding adoption timing, adopter behavior, and pet characteristics to inform strategy.

Business Question:  
How can this shelter improve pet adoption rates and optimize the adoption process using animal and adopter data?

## Key Insights

- Older adopters with previous pet ownership adopt more quickly
- Adoptions peak in June, followed by January, February, and August
- Certain Cat and Dog breeds are returned more frequently

## Tools and Skills Used
- SQL (MySQL): Data segmentation and time-based analysis
- Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- Excel / CSV: Data cleaning and preparation

Keywords: adoption trends, pet return risk, segmentation, seasonal analysis, data storytelling, SQL analysis
